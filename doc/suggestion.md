# Codebase Improvement Suggestions

## Code Structure and Architecture Improvements

### 1. Consistent State Management

- **Issue**: The codebase mixes Redux Toolkit with local React state and various context providers, creating inconsistency.
- **Solution**: Standardize state management across the application:
  - Use Redux for global application state (authentication, projects, files)
  - Create a clear separation between global and local component state
  - Document when to use which state management approach
  - Refactor the GlobalState context to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript

### 2. API Service Layer

- **Issue**: API calls are scattered throughout components and Redux slices with duplicated logic.
- **Solution**: Create a dedicated API service layer:
  - Centralize all API calls in a `/services` directory with consistent error handling
  - Implement request/response interceptors for common tasks (auth, error handling)
  - Create type-safe API client with automatic token management
  - Add request caching strategies for improved performance

### 3. Type Safety Improvements

- **Issue**: Inconsistent TypeScript usage with many `any` types and missing interfaces.
- **Solution**:
  - Define comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
  - Remove all `any` types and replace with proper type definitions
  - Implement strict type checking in the TypeScript configuration
  - Add runtime type validation for API responses using Zod

### 4. Component Architecture

- **Issue**: Components are often too large with mixed responsibilities.
- **Solution**:
  - Refactor large components into smaller, focused ones
  - Implement a clear component hierarchy (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates)
  - Create consistent prop interfaces for all components
  - Add proper documentation for complex components

### 5. Error Handling

- **Issue**: Error handling is inconsistent and often missing.
- **Solution**:
  - Implement a global error boundary system
  - Create consistent error handling patterns for async operations
  - Improve error reporting and logging
  - Add user-friendly error messages and recovery options

## Code Quality and Maintainability

### 1. Code Duplication

- **Issue**: Significant code duplication in transcription handling, audio processing, and file management.
- **Solution**:
  - Extract common functionality into reusable hooks and utility functions
  - Create shared components for repeating UI patterns
  - Implement a design system for consistent UI elements

### 2. Testing Infrastructure

- **Issue**: No visible testing infrastructure in the codebase.
- **Solution**:
  - Set up Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration testing
  - Implement Cypress for end-to-end testing
  - Add test coverage reporting and minimum coverage requirements
  - Create test utilities for common testing scenarios (auth mocking, etc.)

### 3. Code Organization

- **Issue**: Inconsistent file organization and naming conventions.
- **Solution**:
  - Implement feature-based directory structure
  - Standardize file naming conventions (kebab-case vs. PascalCase)
  - Create index files for cleaner imports
  - Organize imports consistently across files

### 4. Performance Optimization

- **Issue**: Several performance bottlenecks in large component renders and data processing.
- **Solution**:
  - Implement proper memoization strategies (useMemo, useCallback)
  - Add virtualization for long lists using react-window or similar
  - Optimize expensive computations with web workers
  - Implement code splitting and lazy loading for routes

### 5. Environment Configuration

- **Issue**: Hard-coded backend URL and lack of environment-specific configuration.
- **Solution**:
  - Create proper environment configuration system
  - Remove hard-coded values from the codebase
  - Add configuration validation on startup
  - Document configuration options for different environments

## Security Improvements

### 1. Next.js Vulnerability

- **Issue**: Current Next.js version (14.2.5) has known security vulnerabilities.
- **Solution**: Update to the latest stable version to address security issues.

### 2. Authentication Hardening

- **Issue**: JWT tokens stored in localStorage are vulnerable to XSS attacks.
- **Solution**:
  - Move tokens to HttpOnly cookies
  - Implement token refresh strategy
  - Add CSRF protection
  - Implement proper token validation and expiration handling

### 3. API Security

- **Issue**: No clear rate limiting or abuse prevention.
- **Solution**:
  - Implement frontend-side request throttling
  - Add proper input validation for all forms
  - Sanitize user-generated content
  - Add protection against common attacks (XSS, CSRF)

## Feature Enhancements

### 3. Collaborative Features

- **Feature**: Real-time collaboration:
  - Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
  - Add commenting and annotation system
  - Create version history and change tracking
  - Support for multiple editors with conflict resolution

### 4. Accessibility Improvements

- **Feature**: Make the application more accessible:
  - Implement proper ARIA attributes throughout
  - Add keyboard navigation support
